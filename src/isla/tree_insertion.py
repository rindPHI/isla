    """
    The reverse embedding method attempts to

    1. Find the first node in :code:`original_tree` that fits into a hole in
       :code:`tree_to_insert`. The tree above that node must be linear, i.e.,
       each node most have exactly one child.
    2. Adds the subtree of that node in :code:`original_tree` as a subtree of
       the hole in :code:`tree_to_insert`.
    3. Adds the resulting tree to the part of :code:`original_tree` that is above
       the node that was found in step 1.

    If there are any collisions in step 3, e.g., because both trees start with the
    :code:`<start>` nonterminal, the nodes from :code:`original_tree` are
    preferred.

    More precisely, we aim to find nodes matching the following setup::

           original_tree:        tree_to_insert:

              <start>               tti_root
                 |                 /   |   \
              parent                 hole
         orig_tree_subtree

    such that the following tree is grammatically valid (for a suitable
    instantiation of the new connecting parts `|*` between (1) parent and tti_root and
    (2) hole and orig_tree_subtree)::

             <start>
                |
             parent
                |*
            tti_root
            /   |  \
              hole
                |*
         orig_tree_subtree

    All nodes of the original tree must be preserved. If necessary, the
    root node of tree_to_insert is removed and replace by an existing
    node with the same label from the original tree.
